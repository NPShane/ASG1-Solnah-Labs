      <h2>Solnah Labs: the History</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2016, NP graduate Sehna set up his own game company with two of his
        longtime friends: Micheael and Juen-Sing. All three of them had yearned
        for the creative freedom that came with running their own company, and
        were daring enough to take the risk despite having no prior experience
        managing a studio and developing their own games.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The first few years were hard and motivation among the three was low.
        They solidered on to develop their own unique mark on the gaming
        industry with their new IP, then called NeonFPS. However, 2020 brought
        much success for the team. Alongside NeonFPS, Solnah Labs had been
        brought on to help with external projects such as Strikedown, Sword Art
        Online and Knights of SPADE.

      <br />
      <p>
        In 2022, Solnah Labs launched their most ambitious project yet: their
        completed FPS experience, now renamed from NeonFPS to VectorShot. Since
        then, fans have been on the lookout for Solnah Labs' next move. Will
        there be a new IP? More features in their current games? Our only answer
        is to wait and see.
